Hello World!
My name is Joseph Nielsen. I am 35 years old and have been working as a chef for the last 15 years. I graduated from Le Cordon Bleu in London in 2005 and began working my way through the Food & Beverage industry until the Covid-19 pandemic began in March 2020. I am now working to complete the UCI Coding Bootcamp to pivot into a new career that I hope to somehow combine with my F&B skills to gain a competetive edge in the industry.
